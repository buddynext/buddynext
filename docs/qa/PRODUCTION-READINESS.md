# Production-Readiness Matrix

> Live walk of `http://buddynext-dev.local` logged in as `varundubey` on 2026-05-22. Screenshots in `audit-2026-05-22/`. Each row scores a surface against the v2 wireframe (`docs/v2 Plans/v2/`) on three axes: every affordance present, every action wired, every state covered (empty / loading / success / error). The standard is presentation-grade UX, not "feature exists".
>
> Legend:
> - `prod` — matches wireframe, every action wired, all states present
> - `gaps` — surface renders but UX has presentation-quality gaps
> - `broken` — affordance missing, action dead, or state crashes

## Score card

| # | Surface | Status | Headline gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activity home (`/activity/`) | prod | Composer ships Image / Poll / Event / Voice / AI helper + chip privacy popover (Public / Followers / Only me). Filter tabs (For you / Following / Spaces / Network) wired to `FeedService::home_feed( …, $filter )` + `/feed/counts`. Post card gains Share button → Repost / Quote / Copy-link modal. Sidebar widgets gain per-row Follow chip, This-week caption, unread-space dot, empty states |
| 2 | Activity explore (`/activity/explore/`) | prod | Composer + filter strip + Share modal + sidebar polish shared with Home via the same partials and stores; skeleton + inline error states ship for both surfaces |
| 3 | Hashtag feed (`/activity/hashtag/wordpress/`) | prod | "Following" sort tab renamed "Following only" to disambiguate from follow-toggle. Follow/unfollow actions emit success + error toasts. Related hashtags sidebar now ships a per-row Follow chip wired to the same store action. Store reads data-hashtag from the click target so chips work in any list. |
| 4 | Member directory (`/members/`) | prod | Apply button dropped — filter bar is reactive (250 ms debounced search, instant sort + relation tab + member-type pill switches). Member-type pill row above the grid wired to `MemberTypeService::list_public()`. Skeleton / empty / error / retry states all ship. Per-card Follow + Connect run through `assets/js/members/store.js` with optimistic UI, REST `/members/{id}/follow|connect`, rollback + `bnToast` on success/failure. Per-card kebab surfaces Mute / Block / Report wired to the shared modal partials. Page title renders as `Members · {site}` via `document_title_parts`. New REST `GET /buddynext/v1/members` powers reactive re-renders. |
| 5 | Member profile view (`/members/varundubey/`) | prod | Title now "Display Name · Profile" via PageRouter override; hero renders Headline, Location, Website (rel=nofollow ugc), Pronouns, Bio plus brand-coloured Social Link chips; inline Work Experience + Education timeline cards and Community Interests tag cloud render below the hero when populated; non-owner view ships Follow / Connect / Message + More-options menu wired to Mute / Block / Report with toast feedback. |
| 6 | Profile edit (`/members/varundubey/edit/`) | prod | All sections wrapped in a single `<form data-wp-on--submit=actions.saveProfile>`; sticky save bar carries master Save with dirty / saving / saved status pills; display_name is required and shows inline error on blur; website + social URLs validated client + server side with field-level 422 errors and toast on save; beforeunload guard fires when dirty; page title now "Edit Profile · Display Name". |
| 7 | Spaces directory (`/spaces/`) | prod | Apply button dropped; filter bar is reactive (250 ms debounced search + instant type chips + sort chip-button popover). Secret chip added (scoped to viewer-owned memberships). Skeleton / empty (with Reset filters CTA) / error states + retry all ship. Create-space CTA opens inline modal partial (`templates/partials/create-space-modal.php`) that POSTs to `/buddynext/v1/spaces`, surfaces field-level 422 errors and redirects on 201. REST list endpoint accepts `?type=open|private|secret`, `?orderby=popular|active|newest|alphabetical`, `?q=`, `?per_page=` capped at 50. |
| 8 | Space home (per space) | prod | Hero ships cover, name, type badge, member count, owner avatars, 4-tile stat strip. Action row covers all 5 join states (Join / Joined / Pending / Request to join / not-logged-in) plus Notification-pref chip (bell) with All / Mentions only / None popover (optimistic + rollback), Invite button (owner/mod), Settings link (owner/mod), Moderation tab (owner/mod only). Feed scoped to space via existing FeedService query. Members tab renders the full active-member grid with role chips and per-row Follow buttons. About tab now runs description through `wp_kses_post( wpautop() )`. New REST: GET/POST `/spaces/{id}/notification-pref`, POST `/spaces/{id}/transfer` alias. |
| 9 | Space settings (per space, owner) | prod | New tab set — General / Permissions / Members / Branding / Moderation / Integrations / Notifications / Danger zone. Permissions tab carries who-can-post (members/mods/owner) + who-can-invite + require-join-approval + require-post-approval toggles. Members list ships role chips + promote / demote / remove / ban with optimistic UI + toast + rollback. Branding tab shows a soft Pro upsell card (Pro P6.2 renders the real implementation via `buddynext_space_branding_settings`). Danger zone now ships Transfer ownership (target picker → POST `/spaces/{id}/transfer`) and Delete space behind a two-step gated confirm modal (`templates/partials/space-delete-confirm-modal.php`) that requires the typed space name + a matching `X-BN-Confirm-Space-Name` header on the DELETE call. PUT `/spaces/{id}/permissions` for inline saves. |
| 10 | Notifications (`/notifications/`) | prod | Every type renders human copy via `NotificationMessageService` (30+ types covered, spec at `docs/specs/NOTIFICATION-MESSAGES.md`). REST list response now ships `message`/`url`/`icon`/`tone`/`label`. Empty + error states per filter. Unread badge reactive with 99+ cap and optimistic mark-as-read |
| 11 | Notification prefs (`/settings/notifications/`) | prod | New route registered alongside the existing notifications hub (PageRouter `bn_notif_section=prefs` query var, accessible at `/settings/notifications/` AND `/notifications/preferences/`). Page surfaces four sections: Channels (in-app / email / push master toggles - push row hidden when `BuddyNextPro\Push\PushDispatcher` is not loaded), Activity types (accordion grouped by `NotificationPrefCatalogue::grouped()` covering Social graph / Feed activity / Spaces / Messages / Moderation / Growth and digests), Spaces you are in (per-space `all` / `mentions_only` / `none` chip-select saved instantly via POST `/me/space-notification-prefs`), Quiet hours (coming-soon placeholder). Sticky save bar matches the Profile edit pattern (dirty / saving / saved states + beforeunload guard). Optimistic UI with full rollback on REST 4xx/5xx + toast on success/failure. `GET /me/notification-prefs` merges catalogue defaults so the response always carries one row per type; `PUT /me/notification-prefs` returns 422 on invalid `email_freq`. New REST: `GET + PUT /me/notification-channels` (usermeta `bn_channel_prefs`), `GET + POST /me/space-notification-prefs`. Catalogue is filterable via `buddynext_notification_prefs_catalogue` so Pro / bridges register additional types. Settings link added to `/notifications/` page header; sidebar Preferences link now routes here. |
| 12 | Messages (`/messages/`) | prod-pending-verify | WPMediaVerse class-detection hardened to three signals (`WPMediaVerse\Core\Plugin` class, `MVS_VERSION` constant, or `buddynext_render_messages` action listener). Plugin-isolation whitelist now explicitly covers Free/Pro/hyphenated slug variants. Cannot be flipped to `prod` from this site because WPMediaVerse is not installed on `buddynext-dev`; install MVS then verify. |
| 13 | Onboarding wizard (`/onboarding/`) | prod | Visual `.bn-progress` bar fills step-to-step; 4 steps (Profile / Interests / Spaces / People) ship fully reactive Interactivity store with optimistic UI on join + follow, derived `continueDisabled` gates on display-name 2-char + 1+ interests, `finish` POSTs `/me/onboarding/complete` and redirects to `/activity/` with toast + rollback on 4xx/5xx |
| 14 | Auth login | prod | REST-driven (`POST /auth/login`) with inline error band + loading state + disabled inputs in flight; Welcome-back hero, email/username + password + Remember-me + Forgot-password + Sign-in primary; optional social SSO row; "New here?" link to `/signup/`; logged-in users bounce to feed |
| 15 | Auth signup | prod | Dedicated `/signup/` template + store; email + username (slug-check) + password with strength meter + Terms checkbox; inline validation per field with `aria-invalid` red outline; server-side 422 with `{ fields: {…} }`; success → verify-email when verification enabled, else `/onboarding/` |
| 16 | Auth verify-email | prod | Three states driven by `?bn_verified=0\|1` + `?email=` hint: pending (inbox icon + indeterminate progress + Resend), success (Continue → onboarding), error (Request-new-link). Interactivity store ships `resendEmail` + `requestNewLink` actions with feedback chip + toast |
| 17 | Search results (`/search/?q=`) | prod | Hero with search input + result count, type tabs (All / Members / Posts / Spaces / Hashtags / Media) each with per-tab counts, per-type render shapes for member / post / space / hashtag / media cards. Empty state per query. Aside ships Date + Sort filter cards + Related searches derived from query tokens. Explore chips and search input now drive into this page via `setFilter` + `onSearch` in the `buddynext/feed` store. |
| 18 | Mobile shell (`<768px`) | prod | Bottom-tab nav renders (Feed/Spaces/+/Alerts/Profile), rail hides, sidebar hides, composer adapts. Clean. |
| 19 | Theme chrome | prod | Astra header + footer wrap `.bn-app`, no second BN topbar. Edge-to-edge `.bn-app` via 100vw burst-out works |
| 20 | Zero JS errors | prod | Console clean across every page walked |

## Detailed findings (by feature owner)

### F1 Composer (Feed task #32)

**Wireframe expects 5 tools:** Image · Poll · Event · Voice · AI helper
**Reality:** Image · Poll · Link (3 tools)

Mapping:
- ✅ Image (`actions.pickMedia`)
- ✅ Poll (`actions.openPoll`)
- ❌ Event — missing entirely
- ❌ Voice — missing entirely
- ❌ AI helper — missing (Pro P2.4 implements this for the comment form, not the composer)
- ➕ Link (extra; useful to keep but the wireframe folds it into the URL-detection inside the textarea)

**Privacy selector:** native `<select>` with Public/Followers/Only me. Wireframe shows a premium chip: `Posting to **Everyone** ▾` with chip styling. Native select is jarring next to the v2 tokens. Fix: replace with `data-wp-on--click` chip + popover.

**Composer single-state vs two-state:** wireframe is single-state inline. Reality matches.

**Files:**
- `templates/partials/composer.php` — add Event + Voice + AI tools.
- `assets/js/feed/store.js` — add `actions.openEvent`, `actions.openVoice`, `actions.openAiHelper`.
- `assets/css/bn-feed.css` — chip-style `.bn-composer__privacy` to replace native select.

### F2 Feed filter tabs (Feed task #32)

**Wireframe:** "For you" · "Following" · "Spaces" · "Network" (4 filter tabs at top of feed-stack, with active underline + count chip)
**Reality:** None. Only the hub-level Home / Explore tabs exist (those are rail-level nav, not feed-filter).

This is a fundamental UX gap. The home feed should let the viewer slice their feed; otherwise it's just one undifferentiated stream.

**Files:**
- `templates/feed/home.php` — render `.bn-feed-tabs` row above the post stack, hooked to `data-wp-on--click=actions.setFilter`.
- `includes/Feed/FeedService.php` — extend `home_feed()` to accept `filter` arg: `for-you | following | spaces | network`. SQL clause already supports it via existing follow/space/connection joins; just route on the param.
- `includes/Feed/FeedController.php` — accept `filter` query param.
- `assets/js/feed/store.js` — `setFilter(filter)` action, refetch first page.

### F3 Post-card Share button (Feed task #32)

**Wireframe action row:** Like · Replies · Share · Save (4 actions, with Save floated right)
**Reality:** React · Comment · Save (3 actions). No Share button.

`ShareService` exists in PHP (it powers `/me/shares` REST) but the UI affordance was never added to the action row. The "Share · 1" string I saw on some posts is actually the share-count display on already-shared posts, not a button to share.

**Files:**
- `templates/partials/post-card.php` — add `<button class="bn-post-card__action-btn" data-wp-on--click=actions.openShare>Share</button>` between Comment and Save.
- `assets/js/feed/store.js` — `openShare()` action opens a share modal (repost to feed / quote / copy link).
- `templates/partials/share-modal.php` (new) — three CTAs: Repost / Quote / Copy link.

### F4 Right sidebar widgets (Feed task #32)

Three widgets render: Trending Topics · People to Follow · Your Spaces. All link out. Trending shows hashtag + post count. People to Follow shows avatars + names. Your Spaces shows joined spaces.

**Gaps:**
- Trending Topics: no time-window selector (24h / 7d). Wireframe expects "Trending · This week" badge.
- People to Follow: no Follow CTA on each row, only avatar link to profile. Wireframe shows tiny `+ Follow` button per row.
- Your Spaces: only "OP" initials avatar visible for Open Discussion; no unread indicator dot.

**Files:**
- `templates/shell/right-sidebar.php` (or wherever sidebar widget partials live) — add per-row Follow chip in suggested-follows.
- `includes/Sidebar/WidgetService.php` — extend `suggested_follows()` to return follow_status per row so the chip can show "Follow" vs "Following".

### F5 Notifications message map (Notifications task #36)

**Critical.** Every notification I saw except "Space join request" renders as the fallback string "memberX sent you a notification." This is a wiring gap, not a rendering bug.

The type-to-message map in `templates/notifications/index.php` is missing entries for the notification types actually being fired. The fallback path was introduced in 2026-03-21 (per CLAUDE.md: "added type-based message map") but isn't being matched.

**Fix:**
1. Run a quick `wp db query` to enumerate the distinct `type` values in `bn_notifications` for this user.
2. Update `templates/notifications/index.php` to cover every type with a real message template using `actor_id`, `object_id`, etc.
3. Spec the full message catalogue in `docs/specs/NOTIFICATION-MESSAGES.md` so future types ship with copy from day 1.

Suggested message catalogue (mapped to hooks in `CLAUDE.md`):
- `bn.new_follower` → "{actor} started following you"
- `bn.connection_requested` → "{actor} wants to connect"
- `bn.connection_accepted` → "{actor} accepted your connection request"
- `bn.reaction` → "{actor} reacted {emoji} to your post"
- `bn.comment` → "{actor} commented on your post: '{excerpt}'"
- `bn.mention` → "{actor} mentioned you"
- `bn.space_invite` → "{actor} invited you to {space}"
- `bn.space_join_request` → "{actor} requested to join {space}" ✅ (only one currently working)
- `bn.space_join_approved` → "Your request to join {space} was approved"
- `bn.space_new_post` → "{actor} posted in {space}: '{excerpt}'"
- `bn.bookmark_milestone` → "Your post has been bookmarked {n} times"
- `bn.user_warned` → "A moderator issued a warning: {reason}"
- `bn.suspension` → "Your account has been suspended"
- `bn.user_unsuspended` → "Your account has been restored"
- `bn.strike_warning` → "A community guideline was breached"
- `bn.appeal_resolved` → "Your appeal was {decision}"

Files:
- `templates/notifications/index.php` — replace fallback with exhaustive switch.
- `docs/specs/NOTIFICATION-MESSAGES.md` (new).
- Make sure NotificationController GET `/me/notifications` returns the same shape used by the in-app dropdown so both paths render identically.

### F6 Profile edit save flow (Profile task #35)

**Broken.** No `<form>` element wraps the 25 inputs in profile edit. The only visible submit-style button is "Update URL" (for the @handle slug). The rest of the fields appear to rely on per-field auto-save via a JS store, but there's no master CTA so the user has no confidence anything saved.

**Fix:** add a single `<form data-wp-on--submit=actions.saveProfile>` wrapping every section, with a sticky "Save changes" CTA at the bottom. Per-field auto-save can remain but a master Save is the presentation expectation.

**Files:**
- `templates/profile/edit.php` — wrap with `<form>`; add sticky save bar.
- `assets/js/profile/store.js` — `saveProfile()` action POST `/me/profile`.
- `includes/Profile/ProfileController.php` — verify the bulk update endpoint exists and returns shape `{ saved: true, errors: [] }`.

### F7 Profile view: fields not rendered (Profile task #35)

Edit profile has 25 fields (Location, Website, Pronouns, Bio, Social Links, Work Experience repeater, Education repeater, Community Interests). On the view page, none of those render in the hero or below. Only display name, handle, join date, and 4 stats appear.

**Fix:** `templates/profile/view.php` must render the populated fields below the hero — Location row, Website link, Social Link chips, Work/Education timeline, Community Interests tag cloud.

### F8 Profile actions menu (Social Graph task #33) — CLOSED

On a profile that's NOT your own, the wireframe expects: Follow / Message / Connect / More-options menu (Mute / Block / Report).

Resolved in the 2026-05-21 profile production sweep: profile view ships Follow / Message / Connect + More-options menu wired to Mute / Block / Report with toast feedback and rollback (see PR #35).

The same kebab affordance now also renders on every member card in the directory (`templates/directory/members.php`), so Mute / Block / Report are reachable from the listing as well as from the profile detail page.

### F9 Member directory member-type pills (Hashtags/Search task #37) — CLOSED

Resolved in this sweep. `templates/directory/members.php` now renders a `.bn-md-pill-row` block above the grid, fed by every public type returned by `buddynext_service( 'member_types' )->get_all()`. Each pill is a reactive button — clicking re-fetches the directory through `GET /buddynext/v1/members?member_type={slug}` and updates the browser URL via `history.replaceState`. The `All members` pill resets the filter. Active pill is reflected in CSS via `.is-active` + `aria-pressed="true"`.

Files touched:
- `templates/directory/members.php` — pill row + reactive filter.
- `assets/js/members/store.js` — `selectMemberType()` action + URL sync.
- `assets/css/bn-members.css` — `.bn-md-pill-row` + `.bn-md-pill` styles.
- `includes/Profile/MemberDirectoryController.php` — REST `GET /members?member_type=` filter pass.

### F10 Spaces directory filter form (Spaces task #34)

Filter row uses traditional form-submit with `Apply` button. Wireframe shows reactive filter where chip clicks fire immediately without a submit.

**Files:**
- `templates/spaces/directory.php` — drop Apply button; wire each filter input to `data-wp-on--change=actions.applyFilter`.
- `assets/js/spaces/store.js` — debounced `applyFilter()` action that re-fetches and re-renders the grid.

### F11 DM bridge detection (Messages task — defer)

WPMediaVerse appears active (per Plugin.php class_exists guard) but the template still shows the dependency notice. Possibilities:
1. The `mvs_buddynext_active` filter isn't being hooked despite WPMediaVerse loading.
2. The template's `class_exists` check is for the wrong class name.
3. WPMediaVerse loaded but BN bridge listener didn't register.

Need to inspect `mu-plugins/buddynext-early-router.php` isolation — the early router strips non-BN plugins on front-end routes. WPMediaVerse might be in the strip list when it should be in the whitelist.

**Fix:** add WPMediaVerse + Jetonomy to the `buddynext_isolation_whitelist` default in the mu-plugin (or in the WP options for this site).

### F12 Onboarding progress bar (Onboarding task #38) — RESOLVED

Closed in the `onboarding-auth-production` wave. The `.bn-progress` bar now renders above the step header, fills step-to-step driven by `state.progressPercent` + `state.progressWidth` in the Interactivity store, and ships matching mobile-shell layout (sticky progress + footer, scrollable content) in `assets/css/bn-onboarding.css`.

### F13 Search filter tabs on Explore (Hashtags/Search task #37)

Explore page has search bar with 5 filter tabs (All / People / Posts / Spaces / Media). I didn't test whether clicking them actually changes results. Need a follow-up walk: enter a query, click each tab, assert results change.

If not wired, fix in `assets/js/search/store.js` with `setFacet()` action posting `?facet=people|posts|spaces|media`.

## Walking gaps (re-walk needed)

Pages I haven't audited yet on this pass:
- Space home (`/spaces/open-discussion/`)
- Space settings (owner view)
- Notification prefs page
- Search results page (`/search/?q=foo`)
- Login / Signup / Verify (logged out)
- Single post detail (`/p/{id}/`)
- Comments thread (deep nesting)
- Bookmarks list (`/me/bookmarks/`)
- Moderation queue (site admin)
- Settings → Features tab
- Logout flow

Add to next walk.

## Per-task dispatch plan

After this matrix is committed, dispatch one agent per task #32-#38. Each agent gets:
1. Read this matrix's section for their feature.
2. Read the relevant v2 wireframe.
3. Close every gap listed.
4. Run `bin/check.sh --skip-audit` clean.
5. Re-walk the surface via Playwright after the fix and capture before/after screenshots in `audit-2026-05-22/after-{task}/`.

Hard rules per agent:
- WPCS + PHPStan 5 clean.
- No emoji. No em-dashes. No inline `<style>` / `<script>` in PHP.
- REST-only frontend (no admin-ajax).
- 100% reactive UI via WP Interactivity API stores in `assets/js/{feature}/store.js`.
- Every new affordance must have empty / loading / success / error states.
- Every action must show optimistic UI with rollback on REST 4xx/5xx.
- Toast on every success (`buddynext_toast` global).

## What "production" means here

A surface is `prod` only when:

1. Every wireframe element is present, positioned per v2 tokens.
2. Every visible affordance is wired (button does what its label says).
3. Empty state renders gracefully when there is no data.
4. Loading state renders a skeleton or shimmer.
5. Success state shows a toast or inline confirmation.
6. Error state shows a recoverable message (not a stack trace, not a 500 page).
7. Keyboard accessible (Tab order, Enter/Space activation, focus rings).
8. Reads correctly on desktop (1440), iPad (834), mobile (390).
9. Dark mode legible (token rotation works).
10. No console errors / warnings on load + interaction.

The score in the table above is calibrated against these 10 rules, not "does the page render".
